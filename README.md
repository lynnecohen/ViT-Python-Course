**Highlighted Projects**

**Rick and Morty API Data Export**

  **Overview:**
  A Python script that retrieves paginated data from the Rick and Morty public API and exports complete datasets (characters, episodes, locations) to an Excel workbook using openpyxl.
  
  **What it does:**
  * Fetches API data and handles pagination via recursive traversal
  * Dynamically builds worksheet headers
  * Writes full datasets into separate Excel worksheets
  * Demonstrates the ability to work with real-world API patterns and produce structured spreadsheet outputs.

**City Weather Report (Final Project)**

**Overview:**
A Python script that retrieves data from two APIs—city information and weather data—merges the results, and exports them to an Excel file.

**What it does:**
* Retrieves city information and corresponding weather data
* Merges and enriches entries by matching city names
* Generates an Excel report with two sheets:
  * A master list of cities with weather details
  * A region-organized view with grouped data
* Shows ability to integrate multiple data sources and create clear, organized reports.

**Top Skills Demonstrated**
These projects highlight the following key technical skills:

* Python Programming - Developing clear, functional scripts with custom logic and reusable functions.
* REST API Integration - Making HTTP requests and working with live API endpoints.
* JSON Data Processing - Parsing, merging, and transforming JSON data.
* Excel Automation (openpyxl) - Creating structured spreadsheets programmatically with multiple sheets.
* Paginated API Handling - Extracting full datasets from APIs that use pagination.
